**CONCEPT/PURPOSE:**
What's this app all about?

Game of Thrones Globe Trott is a photo sharing app for all you travel junkies out there.
Weâ€™ve compiled a list of the top 5 country's for GOT film destination locations.
We want this to help inspire your next trip.
GOT shoots largely on-location, primarily in Northern Ireland and
Iceland for scenes in the North, and Croatia and Spain for the South.
With such an impressive roster of medieval cities and stunning islands on
their shoot list, it should come as no surprise that a GOT location tour around
Europe would make for an ideal vacation.
