<h4>What's this site all about?</h4>
<div>
    <h5>For all you travel junkies out there, weâ€™ve compiled a Game of Thrones
       location guide to help inspire your next trip. </h5>
  <h6>The show shoots largely on-location, primarily in Northern Ireland and
    Iceland for scenes in the North, and Croatia and Spain for the South. </h6>
  <h6>With such an impressive roster of medieval cities and stunning islands on
    their shoot list, it should come as no surprise that a GOT location tour around
    Europe would make for an ideal vacation. </h5>
